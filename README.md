# Carbon Decentralized Identifiers

Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a W3C standard for creating and resolving 
persistent, verifiable identifiers without centralized registries or authorities.  
They enable secure, portable, and self-sovereign identity for people, 
organizations, and devices.  

Carbon provides a Java implementation of the 
[Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) 
specification, making it easier to build and integrate DID-based solutions 
in Java applications.

The library defines core primitives such as `Did` and `DidUrl` for working with 
identifiers, together with interfaces for resolving DIDs into DID Documents. 
These components form the foundation for parsing, constructing, and resolving 
identifiers in a modular and extensible way, supporting multiple DID methods 
and resolution strategies.
